Hello! It is the gene analytic program!

This program allows you easily receive the report of blasting the genes.
BLAST or Basic Local Alignment Search Tool finds regions of similarity between biological sequences.
The program compares nucleotide or protein	sequences to sequence databases and calculates the statistical significance.
BLAST can be used to infer functional and evolutionary relationships between sequences
as well as help identify members of gene families.
